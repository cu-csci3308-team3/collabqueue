● User Acceptance Test Plans
1. Song order: If we add the songs hello (Adele), skyfall (Adele), they know (chief
keef), and everyday is halloween (chief keef) in this order, the pool should play
the songs in this order.

2. Using the songs added above, if a song receives an upvote or downvote the
pool should be reorder to play in sequence of highest amount of votes to lowest
amount of votes.

  a. If skyfall receives 1 upvote, everyday is halloween receives 2 upvotes,
     and hello receives 1 downvote, the new order should play as everyday
     is halloween (+2 votes), skyfall (+1 vote), they know (since it has neutral
     votes), hello (-1 votes)

3. Ensure the delete function works. Once a song is deleted make sure songs are
reordered relative to each other once the deleted song is missing. Should also
verify the song’s disappearance in database.
